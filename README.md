**MyMLKit**

This is where I make simpler versions of the existing ML Models so as to have a better understanding of what's under the hood.
A lot of work is yet to be done. This is not even close to a comprehensive collection.

Along with the ML Models, I am also attempting to implement simpler versions of data preprocessing, scaling, and other essential functions.
I'm following along with the guidance from the O'Reilly publication's Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Aurelien-Geron.
